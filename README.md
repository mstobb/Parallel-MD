Parallel-MD
===========

This is an old respository for a summer project completed in 2014.  The main goal was to parallelize a LAMMPS molecular dynamics (MD) simulation in both space and time across a cluster, using the fact that transitions between states were rare.  While we were mildly successful, we ultimately decided to not pursue the idea further.
